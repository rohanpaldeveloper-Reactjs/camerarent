      q: "How does the date-based availability calendar check work?",
      a: "Our system runs an active double-booking collision check. When you query a date range, it checks all active bookings (orders where status is not cancelled) and manual vendor maintenance blackouts. Unavailable dates are highlighted with a line-through in the date dropdown picker, guaranteeing you will never experience double-booked gear on set."
    },
    {
      q: "Why is my KYC verification required, and how long does it take?",
      a: "Because camera packages and anamorphic lenses are high-value equipment, we require a one-time profile verification. You can upload a photo of your Government ID card (Aadhar, PAN, or Passport) in your Customer Dashboard. Our admin desk reviews and approves document files in under 2 hours during active shift hours."
    },
    {
      q: "When do I get my security deposit returned?",
      a: "Security deposits are held as authorization holds on card checkout. Once the rental duration concludes and the vendor confirms there is no sensor burn, water damage, or optical scratches, we cancel the hold. The funds appear back in your account within 24 hours depending on your bank's release timeline."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I extend my rental duration mid-shoot?",
      a: "Yes, you can request extensions in your Dashboard, provided another crew has not already booked the same product unit for overlapping dates. If the gear is available, you will pay the pro-rated daily rates to secure the extension."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer equipment delivery, or is it pick-up only?",
      a: "We support both. During checkout, you can select 'Local Pickup' to collect directly from the supplier's operations hub, or select 'Coordinated Delivery' to have verified courier vans deliver the shock-absorbent camera cases directly to your set."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if a lens gets scratched or gear breaks on set?",
      a: "If damage occurs, please notify the vendor immediately via WhatsApp or our support helpline. If you purchased our optional Damage Waiver protection, your maximum liability is capped at $150. Otherwise, the vendor will assess repair diagnostics and debit costs from your security deposit hold."
